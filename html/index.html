    <li><p>OSINT Frame.work focuses on gathering information from
    free tools or resources. The intention is to help people find free OSINT
    resources. Some of the sites included might require registration or
    offer more data for $$$, but you should be able to get at least a
    portion of the available information for no cost.</p></li>
    <li><p>This framework was originally created with an information
    security point of view. Since then, the response from other fields and
    disciplines has been incredible. I would love to be able to include any
    other OSINT resources, especially from fields outside of infosec. Please
    <a
    href="https://github.com/tgeek77/OSINT-Frame.work/issues">let
    us know</a> about anything that might be missing!</p></li>
    <li><p>Forked from the original OSINT Framework project on Github: <a
